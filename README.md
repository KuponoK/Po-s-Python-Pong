# Pos-Python-Pong

# What is it?
A simple game of Pong made in Python. Two players, two paddles, and one ball. The objective of the game is to use your paddle to hit the ball past the other 
users paddle. Basically Ping Pong but 2D.

# Motivation
I've always been into video games ever since I was a kid and was had the chance to be able to make one for school. I couldn't pass up the oppurtunity. Also, I like 
being able to see what goes on behind the scenes, so being able to work behind the scenes to come out with the final result was an awesome experience.
